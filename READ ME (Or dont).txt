This is the read me document for a data moshing Avidemux script updated by FatCrow. The original script was created by Phil from datamoshing.com. Thanks Phil!



Key Command List:

Control + 1
Remove next I-frame

Control + 2
Remove next 10 I-frames

This script automates deleting I-frames in Avidemux 2.5.6

Load AutoHotkey with the Delete I-frames script running.
When you are ready to remove I-frames place your mouse pointer on the rectangular slider underneath the video.
Press the different key commands above for the amount of I-frames you want to remove to trigger the AutoHotkey script.
The script will then send the key commands needed to delete the requested number of frames.
Have fun moshing!
